Additional async `LINQ` to objects operators for `IAsyncEnumerable<T>`

It's like [MoreLINQ], only asynchronous.

## Operators

### Acquire

Ensures that a source sequence of disposable objects are all acquired
successfully. If the acquisition of any one fails then those successfully
acquired till that point are disposed.

### Aggregate

Applies multiple accumulators sequentially in a single pass over a sequence.

### AggregateRight

Applies a right-associative accumulator function over a sequence.
This operator is the right-associative version of the `Aggregate` operator.

### Assert

Asserts that all elements of a sequence meet a given condition otherwise
throws an exception.

### AssertCount

Asserts that a source sequence contains a given count of elements.

### AtLeast

Determines whether or not the number of elements in the sequence is greater
than or equal to the given integer.

### AtMost

Determines whether or not the number of elements in the sequence is lesser
than or equal to the given integer.

### Backsert

Inserts the elements of a sequence into another sequence at a
specified index from the tail of the sequence, where zero always represents
the last position, one represents the second-last element, two represents
the third-last element and so on.

### Batch

Batches the source sequence into sized buckets.

### Cartesian

Returns the Cartesian product of two or more sequences by combining each
element from the sequences and applying a user-defined projection to the
set.

### Choose

Applies a function to each element of the source sequence and returns a new
sequence of result elements for source elements where the function returns a
couple (2-tuple) having a `true` as its first element and result as the
second.

### CompareCount

Compares two sequences and returns an integer that indicates whether the
first sequence has fewer, the same or more elements than the second sequence.

### Consume

Completely consumes the given sequence. This method uses immediate execution,
and doesn't store any data during execution

### CountBetween

Determines whether or not the number of elements in the sequence is between an
inclusive range of minimum and maximum integers.

### CountBy

Applies a key-generating function to each element of a sequence and returns a
sequence of unique keys and their number of occurrences in the original
sequence.

sequence where zero always represents the last element, one represents the
second-last element, two represents the third-last element and so on.

### DistinctBy

Returns all distinct elements of the given source, where "distinctness" is
determined via a projection and the default equality comparer for the
projected type.

### EndsWith

Determines whether the end of the first sequence is equivalent to the second
sequence.

### EquiZip

Returns a projection of tuples, where each tuple contains the N-th
element from each of the argument sequences. An exception is thrown
if the input sequences are of different lengths.

### Evaluate

### Exactly

Determines whether or not the number of elements in the sequence is equals
to the given integer.

Excludes elements from a sequence starting at a given index

sequence is empty.

### FillBackward

Returns a sequence with each null reference or value in the source replaced
with the following non-null reference or value in that sequence.

each function in the source sequence of functions.

### IndexBy


Applies a key-generating function to each element of a sequence and returns
a sequence that contains the elements of the original sequence as well its
key and index inside the group of its key. An additional argument specifies
a comparer to use for testing equivalence of keys.

### Insert

Inserts the elements of a sequence into another sequence at a specified index.

### Interleave

Interleaves the elements of two or more sequences into a single sequence,
skipping sequences as they are consumed.

by a negative offset.

### Lead

Produces a projection of a sequence by evaluating pairs of elements separated
by a positive offset.

### LeftJoin

Performs a left outer join between two sequences.

### MaxBy

Returns the maxima (maximal elements) of the given sequence, based on the
given projection.

### MinBy

Returns the minima (minimal elements) of the given sequence, based on the
given projection.

### Move

Returns a sequence with a range of elements in the source sequence
moved to a new offset.

### OrderBy

Sorts the elements of a sequence in a particular direction (ascending,
descending) according to a key.

### OrderedMerge

Merges two ordered sequences into one. Where the elements equal in both
sequences, the element from the first sequence is returned in the resulting
sequence.

### Pad

Pads a sequence with default values if it is narrower (shorter in length) than
a given width.

### PadStart

Pads a sequence with default values in the beginning if it is narrower
(shorter in length) than a given width.

### Pairwise

Returns a sequence resulting from applying a function to each element in the
source sequence and its predecessor, with the exception of the first element
which is only returned as the predecessor of the second element

### PartialSort

Combines `OrderBy` (where element is key) and `Take` in a single operation.

### PartialSortBy

Combines `OrderBy` and `Take` in a single operation.

### Partition

sets of keys.

### PreScan

Performs a pre-scan (exclusive prefix sum) on a sequence of elements

### Rank

Ranks each item in the sequence in descending ordering using a default

descending) into a single sequence that preserves that order.

### Split

Splits the source sequence by a separator.

### StartsWith

Determines whether the beginning of the first sequence is equivalent to the

### TagFirstLast

### ToArrayByIndex

Creates an array from an `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` where a function is used to determine
the index at which an element will be placed in the array.

### ToDelimitedString

Creates a delimited string from a sequence of values. The delimiter used
depends on the current culture of the executing thread.
